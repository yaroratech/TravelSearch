# TravelSearch
A program that allows you to traverse the US map using different searches.

In this first example, the BFS finds a path from Atlanta to Houston. All of the nodes explored from the BFS traversal are highlighted in yellow, while the shortest path is highlighted in red. The terminal output contains some statistics, such as the number of nodes that were explored, which exact nodes were explored, and what the length of the shortest path was.
